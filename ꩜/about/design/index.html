<div class="exp">
  <p>A personal website always gives away a lot about how the creator perceives the world and what the person identifies with. In the following, I'll explain how I tried to make this website representative of me. At first, let me separate it into two different layers on an abstract level.</p>
    
  <ol>
    <li>The content layer -> The expression to the outside; what the person actively creates or is interested in, which is summarized by the content</li>
    <li>The design layer -> The inner experience of the creator; what kind of personality, ideals, and views the person has</li>
  </ol><br>

  <u>What I made out of this concept</u>
  <p>1. The different forms of art I engage in, like literature, photography, and digital art, can be found on the homepage.</p>
  <p>The mix between 1. and 2. resulted in a few personal keepsakes with symbolic value, namely the hashes and the echos (opinions) that resonate with me. The links to those two pages can be found on the Misc page.</p>   
  <p>2. Multiple steps have been taken to incorporate certain desires / values / traits etc. into the design of the website:</p>
     
  <ul class="design-list">
    <li>The domain name whose meaning remains unknown: as an undisclosed acronym (at least for you), it stands for the hidden, which is always a part of us but can also be explored in others.</li>
    <li>The domain name that is hard to spell: I acknowledge that it does not easily roll off the tongue, but no person (or, in this case, representation) should be treated and judged too quickly.</li>
    <li>The TLD .xyz: It is not common to stumble over this top-level domain, but for me, it also stands for the opinion that it is not necessary to be conform or agree with societal expectations, as well as an expression of individuality.<br>
    Xyz as a variable or placeholder can also have symbolic significance in the idea that specific meanings are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things but that they can also be created or found in even the most irrelevant or arbitrary things in life (for example, in a top-level domain).</li>
    <li>"Ecken und Kanten": As every person, I am not perfect in all ways possible and have my rough edges as well, which are found in the fonts CirrusCumulus (landing quote + JTGT) Times New Roman (especially the serifs of the categories), as well as the squares with sharp edges. I tried to also include the contrast of harmony with the slow fade-in text animation, the smooth color transitions, and the rounder C161 font.</li></ul><br>

    <u>Design principles</u>
    <ul>
    <li>Order: The squares around the categories and the thumbnails of my artworks are lined up neatly on almost all devices, plus the categories are sorted by their initial letter.</li>
    <li>Integrity: The squares around the categories and the thumbnails of my artworks have the same dimensions (300 px).</li>
    <li>Simplicity: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry out it: <span style="color: crimson">“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.“</span> Regarding this website, I am sure that it is clear to see in which ways I have heavily drawn from this idea:</li>
 </ul>

 <ol>
   <li>implementing a very simple, yet present design</li>
   <li>keeping the amount of content to the necessary</li>
   <li>using few colors, only crimson red as an accent</li>
 </ol><br>

  <p>As a final note, beyond the visual appearance, there is another dimension to discover. When CTRL + U is pressed a new tab opens up which displays the source code of web page you have inspected before. I have included comments here and there to provide more content that can be explored.</p><br>
