Hello JTGT,

Thank you for your message and welcome to Olvid and sorry for this exceptional delay in replying.

Please find some answers to your questions below:

> Is the user data / are the messages locally encrypted?
YES. Metadata as well. All on your device exclusively. You will find further details in our answers to your other questions.

> Does Olvid certificate pinning?
Olvid warns you when a certificate changes on Olvid for Android. Not yet on Olvid for iOS, but it will be proposed later.

> Are the Olvid servers self-hosted or are cloud providers like AWS used?
We use AWS for the message relaying server. Here is why and how: https://olvid.io/faq/server-and-open-source/
Self-hosting is for later.

> What is the jurisdiction of said infrastructure?
Our company is located in France. Olvid is designed by considering all infrastructure (except your devices) as already malicious. Even in the situation where infra would be malicious, Olvid’s security is still guaranteed.

> Do you get a notification if the device / fingerprint changes?
YES since Olvid is not yet multi-device and an Olvid ID can only be used on one device. Here is more about that and how it works: https://olvid.io/faq/backup-your-profiles/
https://olvid.io/faq/olvid-secure-channels/
